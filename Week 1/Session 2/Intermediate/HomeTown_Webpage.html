            <h3>Weather</h3>
            <p>
                Latur is situated 636 metres above mean sea level, on the Balaghat plateau, near the Maharashtra–Karnataka state 
                boundary. It receives its drinking water from the nearby Manjira River, which suffered from environmental degradation 
                and silting in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.[10] As a result of this and lack of implementation of a water 
                management strategy, during the drought of the 2010s the city ran out of water.

            <h5>Temperature:</h5> Temperatures in Latur range from 13 to 41 °C (55 to 106 °F), with the most comfortable time to visit in the winter, which is October to February. 
            The highest temperature ever recorded was 45.6 °C (114.1 °F). The lowest recorded temperature was 2.2 °C (36.0 °F). 
            In the cold season the district is sometimes affected by cold waves in association with the eastward passage of western 
            disturbances across north India, when the minimum temperature may drop down to about 2 to 4 °C (36 to 39 °F).
            <h5>Rainfall: </h5>Most of the rainfall occurs in the monsoon season from June to September. Rainfall varies from 9.0 to 693 
            millimetres (0.35 to 27.28 in) per month. Average annual rainfall is 725 millimetres (28.5 in).

            Recently, Latur has been bearing the brunt of climate change. Extreme weather episodes, including torrential rainfall and even hailstorms in summers, have been showing up in Latur for over a decade now.[14]
